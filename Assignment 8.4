#8.4 Open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line, split the line into a list of words using the split() method. The program should build a list of words. For each word on each line check to see if the word is already in the list and if not append it to the list. When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.

fname = raw_input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
lst = list()                       # list for the desired output
for line in fh:                    # to read every line of file romeo.txt
    word= line.rstrip().split()    # to eliminate the unwanted blanks and turn the line into a list of words
    for w in word:                 # check every element in word    
        if w in lst:               # if element is repeated
            continue               # do nothing
        else :                     # else if element is not in the list
            lst.append(w)          # append     
lst.sort()                         # sort the list (de-indent indicates that you sort when the loop ends)
print (lst)                        # print the list
